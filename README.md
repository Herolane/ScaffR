Philosophy
-----
ScaffR was designed to reduce the amount of boilerplate code that developers have to produce.  When you use ScaffR, you develop with c# and T4, compose your application with powershell, and
deliver it with NuGet.  You don't need to store the generated files in source control, just the instructions of how the application is constructed.
 
Does this work?  Yes.

Technology
-----
ScaffR takes full advantage of the following technologies:

+ NuGet
+ Powershell
+ T4Scaffolding
+ Visual Studio DTE
